Galactic Fuel CMS is a fully featured Content Management System with a focus on usability, responsiveness and full control. It is based on Daylight Studio’s Fuel CMS and CodeIgniter. 
To get you started quickly, we added a simple demo page demonstrating Galactic Fuel CMS’s main functions. Also visit our How-To guides on http://galacticweb.de/blog/categories/galactic-fuel-cms to get more information.

## Changes:
Important things we changed (compared to classic Fuel CMS):

- added Twitter Bootstrap support and a new backend look & feel

- added metisMenu.js for a toggable mobile menu
- added guillotine for live image cropping (e.g. in blog module)
- added new skin to ckedit

- removed last visited documents
- changed jpg icons in favour for great ‘Font Awesome’ icons
