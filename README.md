# galactic-fuel-cms
**Galactic Fuel CMS** is an enhanced, Twitter Bootstrap-powered version of Fuel CMS developed by Galactic Web.
[www.galacticweb.de](http://www.galacticweb.de)

Galactic Fuel CMS is a fully featured Content Management System with a focus on usability, responsiveness and full control. It is based on Daylight Studio’s Fuel CMS ( [daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS](https://github.com/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS) ) and CodeIgniter. 
To get you started quickly, we added a simple **demo page** demonstrating Galactic Fuel CMS’s main functions. Also visit our How-To guides on http://galacticweb.de/blog/categories/galactic-fuel-cms to get more information.


### Installation:
Please visit our [Galactic Web Blog](http://galacticweb.de/blog/categories/galactic-fuel-cms) for more information on how to install Galactic Fuel CMS.


### Changes:
Important things we changed (compared to classic Fuel CMS):

- added Twitter Bootstrap support and a new backend look & feel
- added lightbox.js
- added imageshow for asset files
- added metisMenu.js for a toggable mobile menu
- added guillotine for live image cropping (e.g. in blog module)
- added new skin to ckedit
- added global CSS & JS parameters
- added a simple thumbnail functionality to the asset class (basically it looks for thumbnails in a folder and shows them instead of the original picture)
- added ‘jQuery migrate’ to catch errors due to deprecated functions
- added simple Drag & Drop asset upload (dropzone.js)

- removed last visited documents
- changed jpg icons in favour for great ‘Font Awesome’ icons
- fixed wrong ‘filesize’ info in asset tab
- updated ‘jQuery UI’ to current version (and deactivating big parts like tooltip, due to the use of Bootstrap's better components)
